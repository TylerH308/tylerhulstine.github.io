## [Human Genome Data](https://www.internationalgenome.org/data)
### This data set is the largest public collection of human genetics. The collection of this data started in 2008 and went on until 2015. Some uses are It can be used to discover how different genes can affect overall health as well as resistance or vulnerability to certain diseases. Another use can be how genetics play a role in someoneâ€™s preferences, such as types of foods they prefer or the type of area they live in such as rural, suburban, or urban. Also, by studying how genetically diverse populations are we can draw conclusions on immigration/emigration of that area over time.  It also can be used to analyze what areas had early hominids and the differences between modern homo sapiens and those early hominids.
